# Lib Catalog API

![architecture](./.github/architecture.gif)

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This is an `api` that simulates an api of a fictitious company (_Lib Catalog_) that stores and makes digital documents available.

## About the Problem üñäÔ∏è

_Lib Catalog_ is a Digital Document Library Company that processes thousands of documents every day in order to store and make these documents available for multiple users to access. It also has a _metrics system_ that evaluates the number of documents that a user has uploaded and returns this in point format depending on the relevance of the document, number of likes, and size of the document, size in MB - MegaBytes that is later placed in a ranking for all users to view the most relevant documents on a topic. The rankings are separated into real-time rankings, daily rankings and weekly rankings. At the end of each week, an email is sent to users updating the weekly ranking. This company has a problem with having a system to manage this information and make it quickly available to its users.

Suppose that relevance is given by:

```
Relevance = 0.1 * Document Size (MB) + 0.9 * Number of Likes
```
